#### __Game Description__


----------

#### __Mechanics__
> * __Survival__: Player has finite number of lives which are lost upon crashes into objects and the map edges
> * __Movement__: Player controls his space shipâ€™s movement by rotating his ship and by firing a rocket propulsion pulse. She may exploit gravity by orbiting around planets.
> * __Map Objectives__: Player must round up a certain quota of cows on each level and reach the Space Ranch on the map. He lassos cows by either encircling them geometrically with the path of his ship or by shooting a lasso rope in one direction
> * __Burst__: Player has limited number of burst to alter the track of spaceship in order to collect more resource and reach the Space Ranch.
> * __Space Effects__: Player must engage with various space effects such as worm holes (map teleportation effect) and deadly astroids.
> * __Cow usage__: Player aims to collect more mad cow for currency, which can be used in Space Shop.
> * __Space Shop__: Player can purchase advanced spaceship, spaceship parts and life in Space Shop. Space Shop locates at certain levels, which can be visited by traveling through it.
