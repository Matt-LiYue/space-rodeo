How to write a level

In the new level editor, there are 11 values per line.Each of these can be used as parameters for the objects placed on a map. If a value is not used for an object, simply use a zero for the parameter. Each parameter is separated by a single space. An example with the parameters is below.

Object Width Height Radius Gravity Burst X Y Point Period
S 300 100 30 5 0 0 0 0 0 0
C 400 100 20 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
R 500 100 50 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A 200 100 20 10 0 -5 5 10 10

Please see level0.txt as an example.
