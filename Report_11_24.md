* __Design Clarification__

The pure puzzle game has multiple stand-alone levels. Player has to collect all cows in a level to finish it. There are totally 6 levels with increasing difficulty. More space effects are presented  in the levels. 

* __New feature__

__A real Billy__: We now have a real Billy drawn by ourselves instead of using images from the Internet. Billy has 8 frames to show animations:

Animation of Billy includes: Shoot a lasso, burst, brake

  __Smooth orbit:__ Fixed the orbit gap. We are still using vector-based method to implement the orbiting while not having orbit gap.

  __Planet Gravity:__ Spaceship will be pulled towards the orbiting planet slowly. So eventually the ship will crash on the planet if orbiting too long.
  
  __Guidline:__ Used to provide more information such as gravity field of a planet and wormhole pairs. 
  
  __Brake:__ decelerate
  
  __Moving Planet:__ Planet can orbit a sun
  
  __More animations:__
crash, rope, lasso, background, burst, brake

  __Transition screens__
  __More levels__ (6 in total)
  __Music and more sound effects__


* __Contribution:__
  Yue: Multi-dimensional lasso, crash animation, fix passing by values, enlarge the game, background animation, transition screens, more levels

  Michael: Draw Billy, smooth orbit, guideline, brake, moving planet and planet gravity, rope animation, more levels
  
  Kate: Updated map editor, Music and sound effects, more levels, CREDIT and CONTROL instructions.
